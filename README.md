# DocDoc

A Doc[tor] for your Doc[umentation]'s invalid links.


## Installation

```
$ gem install doc_doc
```


## Usage

```
$ doc_doc 'https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/Logging' --stay-within 'https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki' > invalid_links.json
```

`invalid_links.json` identifies links that could use a little doctoring:

```json
{
  "links": [
    {
      "page": "https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/Logging",
      "href": "../DesiredCapabilities",
      "error": {
        "type": "http",
        "status": 404
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Doc Doc aims to find links that:
- lead to pages that do not load (http statuses in the 400 or 500 ranges)
- lead to pages without the elements referenced by the url fragment
